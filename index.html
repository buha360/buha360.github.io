    <h1>Privacy Policy Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to MapCanva!</h2>

    amusing and entertaining designs over the world's road network, turning ordinary maps into pieces of art. Whether you're enhancing the streets of
    Europe with playful drawings or discovering hidden artistic gems created by others, MapCanva offers a unique platform for expression and
    interaction. Our commitment to your privacy is paramount. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect the information you
    provide while using MapCanva. It's designed to ensure you understand our practices and how they adhere to privacy laws and regulations. MapCanva
    is developed by WarDanger, a team dedicated to creating engaging and respectful digital experiences. Our application is built with the intention
    of providing entertainment and connection without compromising user privacy or security. Thank you for choosing MapCanva. Let your creativity roam
    free and leave your mark on the world in an innovative and respectful way.

    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <h4>GPS Location Data</h4>

    At MapCanva, we prioritize your experience and privacy. Our app is designed to use GPS data solely for enhancing your interaction with the map
    features. When you launch MapCanva and if the GPS function is enabled on your device, we use your location data to automatically zoom in to your
    current location on the map. This feature is intended to provide you with a seamless and personalized map drawing experience, allowing you to
    start creating right where you are. We want to assure you that the use of GPS data is completely under your control. If the GPS function is not
    enabled when you start the app, we won't nag you to turn it on. Instead, the app will start with a default view over Europe, and you can manually
    navigate to your desired location. This approach ensures that you are not compelled to share your location if you prefer not to; however, it means
    that the automatic zoom feature will not be available.

    <h4>Privacy by Design</h4>

    After the initial location is used to zoom in to your position, we immediately remove the location indicator icon from the map. This step is taken
    to prevent any accidental leakage of your exact whereabouts, further safeguarding your privacy. It's important for us to clarify that MapCanva
    does not collect, store, or use your GPS location data when the app is closed or not in use. Moreover, we do not share your location data with
    third parties for any purpose. Our commitment to privacy extends beyond the active use of MapCanva. We ensure that no location data is gathered or
    retained when the app is running in the background or when you're not actively using it. Your privacy and the security of your data are paramount,
    and we design our features with this in mind.

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <h4>Access, Modification, and Deletion of Data</h4>

    At MapCanva, we recognize and respect your rights over your personal data. Although our application primarily uses GPS location data temporarily
    and does not store or retain this information, we are committed to ensuring transparency and control over any data interaction. Should there be
    any data collected that qualifies under personal data, users have the right to: Access: Request an overview of the personal data collected.
    Modification: Ask for corrections to their personal data if inaccuracies are found. Deletion: Request the deletion of their personal data from our
    records. To exercise these rights, please contact our support team through the contact information provided in the "Contact Us" section of this
    Privacy Policy. We will respond to your request promptly and guide you through the process of accessing, modifying, or deleting your data.

    <h2>Permissions and Data Protection</h2>
    <h4>Requesting Location Permissions</h4>

    MapCanva is designed to request location permissions in a transparent and straightforward manner. Upon your first use of the app, you will be
    prompted to grant permission for accessing your GPS location. This permission is crucial for the app’s functionality, allowing us to provide a
    personalized and engaging experience by zooming into your current location on the map. We only request permissions that are necessary for the
    app's core functionalities and do not collect location data when the app is closed or not in use. If you choose not to grant location permissions,
    you can still use MapCanva with limited functionality, such as manual navigation and drawing over the default map view.

    <h4>Protecting Your Data</h4>

    Protecting your data and respecting your privacy are fundamental principles at MapCanva. We implement robust security measures to safeguard your
    information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Our commitment to data protection is unwavering, and we continuously
    update our practices to stay ahead of potential risks.

    <h4>Contact Us</h4>

    need assistance or wish to exercise your rights regarding your personal data, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at: Email:

    <h2>Data Privacy Practices</h2>
    <h4>No Data Storage/Collection and Third-Party Sharing</h4>

    We, at MapCanva, are committed to the principle of minimal data usage. It is important for us to clarify and reassure our users that we do not
    store, collect, or retain any personal data beyond the temporary use necessary for enhancing your experience within our app.

    <div>Specifically:</div>
    <li>
      No Persistent Data Storage: Any GPS location data accessed by MapCanva for the purpose of zooming into your current location is not stored
      orretained after your session ends. There is no accumulation of user data over time, ensuring that your privacy is preserved.
    </li>
    <li>
      No Data Sharing: We firmly stand by our promise not to share any data with third parties. Your interaction with MapCanva remains private and is
      not used for any formof data monetization or external analysis.
    </li>
    Internet Access Requirement The requirement for internet access within MapCanva is solely for the purpose of querying road networks and map data
    essential for the app's functionality. This access facilitates the real-time rendering of maps and the drawing features that allow for creative
    expressions over geographical landscapes. Rest assured, this connectivity is used exclusively for operational purposes and does not involve the
    collection or transmission of personal data. GPS Access for Enhanced Functionality GPS access is requested to enable a core feature of MapCanva -
    the ability to automatically zoom to your current location for an immersive and personalized map interaction. Should you choose not to grant GPS
    access, the app defaults to a predetermined view over Europe, allowing you to manually navigate and explore without location-based
    personalization. This approach ensures that the utility and enjoyment of MapCanva are accessible to all users, regardless of their privacy
    preferences regarding location sharing. Our Commitment to Privacy Our dedication to your privacy is unwavering. MapCanva's development and
    operational practices are centered around safeguarding user privacy and ensuring a secure and respectful digital environment. We continuously
    review and update our practices in alignment with industry standards and privacy legislation to ensure the highest level of protection for our
    users. We hope this Privacy Policy provides a clear understanding of our data privacy practices. If you have any questions or require further
    clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us at the details provided in the "Contact Us" section.
